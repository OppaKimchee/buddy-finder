# BUDDY FINDER

## Description
Formerly known as Furry Finder, Buddy Finder was created to serve one purpose and one purpose only-- to bring together separated family members. By utilizing Google Map's API, Buddy Finder provides a virtual map for pet owners and neighbors to easily find, share, and track lost and found pets.  

We're making the world a happier place one step at a time by reuniting furry loved ones with their not so furry families.
